# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart is an important organ in the human body.It works tirelessly ,day and night ,to pump blood to every other organ.But changing lifestyles, stress and unhealthy food are causing various heart related problems. Since last decade, an alarming number of patients are going to  hospitals reporting various symptoms of cardiac problems which makes it even more important to predict any such disease beforehand.In India, cardiac arrest is one of the major contributors to the untimely demise of people.It is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate and many other factors and goes undetected before its too late. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) has become a leading cause of deaths. The annual number of deaths from (Cardiovascular diseases) CVD in India is projected to rise from 2.26 million (1990) to 4.77 million (2020) .According to the World Health Organization, 17.9 million global deaths have been reported from CVDs every year.  
The goal of the project is to predict if a patient is likely to be diagnosed with heart disease or not using his medical history using machine learning.. It recognizes people with symptoms of heart disease such as chest pain or high blood pressure and can help in diagnosing disease with less medical tests and effective treatments, so that they can be treated accordingly.A risk of a heart attack or the possibility of the heart disease if identified early, can help the patients take precautions.
